\section*{Terminology}
	We could think of a sheet of paper passing through all the points in the higher dimension. We give down a triangle involving three of the higher dissertational points. Then we continually pick a point -- form a congruent ``same'' triangle with the new points and two points which have been projected -- along down this new triangle.
